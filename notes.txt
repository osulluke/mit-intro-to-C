This lesson focused on some of the basic compiler options; needless to say, it is much higher quality than what I recieved from PCC. Already, I'm able to use multiple files in the compiler chain, including header files, as well as additional options such as #ifdef flags to choose whether or not to include certain parts of code in the compilation process.

-c flag (gcc -c fib.c rev.c fibrev.c) will produce the object files
-E flag (gcc -E xyz) will execute pre-processing of the files
-o flag (gcc -o xyz) is what I'm used to, and will link the files generating an executable.

#ifdef INCLUDETHIS
	this sequence will allow certain code to be selected for inclusion in a program. you can select it with the addition of a flag in the compliation sequence (gcc -DINCLUDETHIS -o x.c y.c z.c)
#endif

Lesson 2 focused on the control constructs used for looping and testing statements. i.e. if, else, else if, switch, case, do/while, while, and for. Nothing was super new here, but there was a cool exercise regarding coming up with 7 different ways to produce some odd numbers. Was a good exercise to show the connection between the different language syntax and showed the convinience of some of the 'shorthand' methods for testing values and controlling a program.

Lesson 3: Memory management (stacks/pointers/arrays/memory management) - 

	- Main purpose of the call stack is to keep track of where a subroutine should return control to after it finishes its action.
	- When a program calls a function, it pushes a return address onto the stack for the subroutine to use as its 'return address' after it finishes its job. Pushing addresses is called 'winding'...removing them is called 'unwinding'.

	- Using malloc returns a void pointer, meaning it is a pointer to memory space that can then be used for any type of data...this means that it will eventually have to be "cast" to whatever data-type is being used in that memory space.

	- These two code changes in sort.c make it so the sort algorithm takes a pointer to an integer array, and then uses malloc to create a memorty space that is large enough to hold the array of numbers. It also fixes the 'printing' of the program and makes it a little prettier.

	- Finalized resize.c. I included the file by itself, before my code changes, one, to make better use of 'git', and two so I could actually see the changes I made...using git :) lolz. On to lecture 4...

Lesson 4:

	- Valgrind can pick up on memory leaks, use of uninitialized variables, and though the lecture states that it won't check the bounds of statically allocated arrays, it has been producing an error that makes me think these notes from 2012 have been OBE by newer developments in the Valgrind program.
