This lesson focused on some of the basic compiler options; needless to say, it is much higher quality than what I recieved from PCC. Already, I'm able to use multiple files in the compiler chain, including header files, as well as additional options such as #ifdef flags to choose whether or not to include certain parts of code in the compilation process.

-c flag (gcc -c fib.c rev.c fibrev.c) will produce the object files
-E flag (gcc -E xyz) will execute pre-processing of the files
-o flag (gcc -o xyz) is what I'm used to, and will link the files generating an executable.

#ifdef INCLUDETHIS
	this sequence will allow certain code to be selected for inclusion in a program. you can select it with the addition of a flag in the compliation sequence (gcc -DINCLUDETHIS -o x.c y.c z.c)
#endif

Lesson 2 focused on the control constructs used for looping and testing statements. i.e. if, else, else if, switch, case, do/while, while, and for. Nothing was super new here, but there was a cool exercise regarding coming up with 7 different ways to produce some odd numbers. Was a good exercise to show the connection between the different language syntax and showed the convinience of some of the 'shorthand' methods for testing values and controlling a program.

Lesson 3: Memory management (stacks/pointers) - 

	- Main purpose of the call stack is to keep track of where a subroutine should return control to after it finishes its action.
	- When a program calls a function, it pushes a return address onto the stack for the subroutine to use as its 'return address' after it finishes its job. Pushing addresses is called 'winding'...removing them is called 'unwinding'.

	- Using malloc returns a void pointer, meaning it is a pointer to memory space that can then be used for any type of data...this means that it will eventually have to be "cast" to whatever data-type is being used in that memory space.
